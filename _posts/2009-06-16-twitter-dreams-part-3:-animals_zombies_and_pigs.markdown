  title: "Twitter dreams part 3: animals, zombies & pigs"
---

OK, after looking at
[celebrities](/2009/05/twitter-dreams-part-2:-celebrities.html) two other types
of dreams stood out: those involving animals and mythical creatures. Below
you'll see the distribution of the most common animals in dreams reported on
twitter.  Lots of cats, snakes and fishes!

From my own dreams I definitely remember some involving snakes, but not cats or
fishes. Still, animals are powerful symbols in many cultures, for example in
Native American or Chinese mythology. There's a also whole bunch of
interpretations for dreams involving animals, but I won't go into there now.

Somehow related to animals, but not quite the same are dreams of the next
category: mythical creatures. For the first time I tried to use
[streamgraphs](http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/) to get an idea of the
distribution over time, using Andrew Godwin's
[graphication](http://www.aeracode.org/projects/graphication/) library. It's
probably not the best possible visualisation for this type of data, but it is
visually pleasing.

So: Zombies, Werewolves, Vampires: fight!

Zombies are the undisputed leaders in this category, they occur in a lot of
dreams. Are people fearing the [Zombie
Apocalypse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse)? There definitely
is something very modern about the zombie myth, which is more present than
older (or old-fashioned?) mythical creatures like vampires and werewolves.

You'll also notice regular spikes in the number reported dreams, which more or
less coincide with weekends. People either dream more on weekends, or find more
time to tweet about it the next day.

Going back to the zombie apocalypse, another interesting thing I noticed was a
short burst of pig/swine related dreams just as it made news end of April this
year, visualised in the following graph:

</a>

This is a very nice example of how current events (like the swine flu) make
their way into the subconsciousness of our minds.  It's the zombie pig
apocalypse!

Or as [pixistyx](http://twitter.com/pixistyx) says on twitter:
