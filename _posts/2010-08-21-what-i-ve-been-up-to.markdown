With (horror) I realised that the last post on this blog was from last year,
there were a few moments where I was about to post an entry on a project I'd
been working on only to say to myself - sod it, I'm going to write some code instead.

So here's an attempt to summarise some things I've been working on this year,
which I do in many ways for myself, to get an overview (and maybe some missing
narrative), the red string etc.
