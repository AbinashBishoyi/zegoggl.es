Britney Spears, Ophra Winfrey, John Mayer.

What do they have in common? They are appear very frequently in dreams, at least in those written down on [twitter](/2009/05/twitter-dreams-part-1:-introduction.html). The data was obtained by feeding data from twitter searches (courtesy of [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=TFi_Uu313RGmSKSudPQQIA)) into [Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com/api/), then linking them to different categories like [/celebrities/celebrity](http://www.freebase.com/view/celebrities/celebrity) using [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/). Barack Obama is clearly leading, he even has a site dedicated to dreams about him ([dreamsofbarack.com](http://dreamsofbarack.com/)). Oprah's presence in the top ten can probably be explained by her public twitter debut on her show ("[Oprah Fails to Tweet on Her Big Twitter Show](http://gawker.com/5216917/oprah-fails-to-tweet-on-her-big-twitter-show)").

Notice the shape of the distribution following a typical [power law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law).
So... what is happening at the the end of the long tail?

For example there is Tim Burton, [Kendra Wilkinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendra_Wilkinson) and [Jamie Waylett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Waylett). I had to look up the last two, Kendra Wilkinson is a model and former girlfriend of Hugh Hefner's, Jamie Waylett played a Slytherin in the Harry Potter movies and got recently arrested for possession of cannabis according to wikipedia. 

Teen stars Miley Cyrus and Zac Efron are all over Twitter, probably helped by a large teenage twitter user base (however, the average age on twitter is 31, according to [Pew](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/78505)). Hollywood/Disney should consider making a film with both of them (and while they're at it, have with Britney Spears and John Mayer as supporting acts).

Anyway, another interesting thing to look at is gender distribution. Intuitively I was expecting a female majority, but in reality male celebrities are overrepresented, they appear nearly twice as as often as women in dreams (~ 1.82). However this might be slightly skewed since there is no information about the author's gender (men tend to dream more about other men, "[The Dreams of Men and Women: Patterns of Gender Similarity and Difference](http://dreamresearch.net/Library/domhoff_2005c.html)").

Here are some sample tweets, to give you an idea:

  * ["dreamt that i slow danced with zac efron... then twittered about it haha"](http://twitter.com/carrieheffernan/statuses/1484166523)
  * ["I had a dream last night that Tom Cruise was divorcing Katie Holmes and marrying an alien. I'm gonna stay awake forever now."](http://twitter.com/renlong/statuses/1629440904)
  * ["Last night I dreamt I was a tiny chauffeur for Obama. He was too big for my tiny limo, so he had to crouch knees-to-chest on the   roof."](http://twitter.com/lastnightsdream/statuses/1822846891)
  * ["Had a dream last night that I was hanging out with President Obama. He smelled of cigarettes, leather and Old Spice. Super weird."](http://twitter.com/drewpickard/statuses/1631775969)
  * ["dreamt i saw film version of the catcher in the rye with zac efron as holden, miley cyrus as phoebe. terrified i've seen the future."](http://twitter.com/furandloathing/statuses/1800072336)
  * ["I had an awesome dream about Miley. Let's just say we were BFFs and her house was cuh-raaaazy. O and her dad was great too~ hahaha"](http://twitter.com/jessiclesftw/statuses/1451336777)
  * ["had a dream that I met Kendra Wilkinson last night. Weird?"](http://twitter.com/cagefighter13/statuses/1755039193)

When I checked Jamie Waylett's [Freebase entry](http://www.freebase.com/view/en/jamie_waylett) I noticed that someone had already semantically marked up his drug possesion history.

Then I realised that there're also categories for [substance abuse problems](http://www.freebase.com/view/celebrities/substance_abuse_problem) and [sexual orientation phases](http://www.freebase.com/view/celebrities/sexual_orientation_phase) of celebrities. Freebase is awesome.
