Britney Spears, John Mayer and Oprah Winfrey.

What do they have in common? They are appear very frequently in dreams, at least in those written down on 
[twitter](/2009/05/twitter-dreams-part-1:-introduction.html). The data was obtained by feeding data from twitter searches (courtesy 
of [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=TFi_Uu313RGmSKSudPQQIA)) into [Zemanta](http://www.zemanta.com/api/), then linking 
them to different categories like [/celebrities/celebrity](http://www.freebase.com/view/celebrities/celebrity) using 
[Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/). Barack Obama is clearly leading, he even has a site dedicated to dreams about him 
([dreamsofbarack.com](http://dreamsofbarack.com/)). Oprah's presence in the top ten can probably be explained by her public twitter 
debut on her show ("[Oprah Fails to Tweet on Her Big Twitter Show](http://gawker.com/5216917/oprah-fails-to-tweet-on-her-big-twitter-show)").

Teen stars Miley Cyrus and Zac Efron are all over Twitter, probably helped by a large teenage twitter user base (however, 
the average age on twitter is 31, according to [Pew](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/78505)). Hollywood/Disney should consider making 
a film with both of them (and while they're at it, have with Britney Spears and John Mayer as supporting acts).

Here are some sample tweets, to give you an idea of the content:

  * ["Last night I dreamt I was a tiny chauffeur for Obama. He was too big for my tiny limo, so he had to crouch knees-to-chest on the   roof."](http://twitter.com/lastnightsdream/statuses/1822846891)
  * ["Had a dream last night that I was hanging out with President Obama. He smelled of cigarettes, leather and Old Spice. Super weird."](http://twitter.com/drewpickard/statuses/1631775969)
  * ["I had an awesome dream about Miley. Let's just say we were BFFs and her house was cuh-raaaazy. O and her dad was great too~ hahaha"](http://twitter.com/jessiclesftw/statuses/1451336777)
  * ["dreamt i saw film version of the catcher in the rye with zac efron as holden, miley cyrus as phoebe. terrified i've seen the future."](http://twitter.com/furandloathing/statuses/1800072336)
  * ["pretty sure i dreamt i was britney spears. not cheeto-inhaling britney, but dancing w/ a python britney. weeeird."](http://twitter.com/chausettes/statuses/2116579691)

Another interesting thing to look at is gender distribution. Intuitively I was expecting a female majority, but in reality male celebrities are
overrepresented, they appear nearly twice as as often as women in dreams (~ 1.82). Or maybe women talk more about celebrities than men.

You can grab the full list from google tables: <a href="http://tables.googlelabs.com/DataSource?dsrcid=22075/22075">tables.googlelabs.com/DataSource?dsrcid=22075</a>
(you'll need a google account). Fusion Tables is a new google service to collaboratively visualise data, but it's still in pre-alpha, 
some features are missing from it. It doesn't have an API yet either so the data is unfortunately static.
