  title: "goodbye analog tv"
---

The 12th of June, 2009 marks the end for analog television in the Unites States. The Federal Communications Comission (FCC) decided 
that analog television's time was over in what could be called a forced upgrade. This move will free up some frequencies in the analog spectrum which could be used for other applications (most likely digital transmissions protocols like WiFi).

Is this switch historic? I don't know, but some relicts of the analog area are going to disappear. After the the test card disappeared (when TV moved to a 24/7 schedule) the next victim will be the screen of static.

    >The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel. 

That's the famous opening parapraph of the SF novel "Neuromancer" by William Gibson. This imagined future, dating from 1984, has just been made obsolete last week. The noise and static in our TV sets has been replaced by glitchy and chopped up playback from dirty DVDs.
