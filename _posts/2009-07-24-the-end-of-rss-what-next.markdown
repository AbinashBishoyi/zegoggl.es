  title: "The end of RSS, what next?"

RSS has fallen out of fashion. NetNewsWire, my RSS feed reader, currently
reports 4291 unread blog entries. I don't think I'll be able to catch up with
all these unread entries. I'm sure I'm going to miss some nuggets in these 4291
entries, but I'm just not willing to spend hours sifting through all those
feeds. It's a typical scenario in the "information age" - a surplus of valuable
information. Every morning I go throug the same ritual: catching up with email
(mailing lists, personal mails and so on), then my twitter backlog, then my
delicious network. The whole process can easily take up half an hour or more.
What's worse, after finishing this process there are going to be more tweets, emails,
links, youtube videos, Facebook updates, irc messages throughout the day competing for my
attention. In order to get work done I often have to force myself and shut down
my email and twitter client. 

This story might sound familiar, and there still is no good solution for this
problem. Sometimes I'm wondering at which point we're going to experience the
internet backlash - a conscious decision to live our lives offline, as far as
this is still possible (it might be actually be a luxury soon).  Most office jobs
require an internet connection, the more we depend on the internet for our
daily routine the harder it will be to go 'offline'.

There are some initiatives opposing this trend, for example [Shutdown Day](http://www.shutdownday.org/)
(Oh the irony of organising an 'anti-internet movement with the help of the internet).

The website currently returns an empty page, not sure if that's intentional.
Then there are studies like [1] or [2] which overemphasize the value of the internet 
(information over reproduction? our species is doomed).

When is the backlash going to happen? When will Twitter, email, Facebook etc.
go out of fashion and simple, low-tech direct human interaction (writing a letter?)
become more important than before? Influential people like Aaron Swartz have
started to go offline for a whole month ([A Life Offline](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/offline))

Twitter's Alex Payne observes in '[3]' the usefulness of social networks as filter for information. 
The idea is thatwe have a network of people we trust, say the people we follow on twitter, to
provide us with relevant information. No fancy algorithms, just people.
